# TheWolf
The Wolf is a Windows desktop app I wrote to clear folders and files out of your Temp folder.
Windows does not delete most of the telemetry stuff and this slows down a PC.

This program must be ran as an administrator. Either run Visual Studio as an Administrator, or if running the executable the same applies.

Warning: 
Some apps store data in your Temp folder, so this may cause problems for you. So far I haven't noticed anything, except my PC boots faster.
Use this project at your own risk.

The Wolf is a reference to the cleaner in Pulp Fiction.

This project is a prototype for a WIndows Service I am building. The Windows Service will have a database and a list of folders to delete on a regular basis.

This project is a Demo of the following Data Juggler Nuget Packages:
1. DataJuggler.Win.Controls
2. DataJuggler.UltimateHelper

I will build an installer once The Wolf is a little more polished.
